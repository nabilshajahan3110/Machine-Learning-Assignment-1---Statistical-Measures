## Machine-Learning-Assignment-1---Statistical-Measures
An assignment in Jupyter Notebook covering topics on EDA, Outlier Detection, and graphical representation.

It focuses on analyzing house prices in Bangalore with specific attention to the price per square foot.

### Work Completed:
#### 1. Dataset Loading and Setup:

Imported essential libraries (NumPy, pandas, Seaborn, etc.).
Loaded the dataset house_price.csv and created a working copy for analysis.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Previewed the data with head() and tail() to understand its structure.
Identified dataset dimensions using .shape and checked column data types with .info().
Generated statistical summaries with .describe() for numerical columns.
Detected and handled missing/null values.
Checked for duplicate rows, removed them, and verified changes.
#### 3. Outlier Detection:

Introduced tasks aimed at detecting outliers, potentially using statistical measures like Z-scores, IQR, or visualization techniques (although specifics need further clarification).

### Initial Insights:

The dataset cleaning steps—like handling duplicates and checking for null values—ensure the data is reliable for analysis.
The structured approach to EDA sets a strong foundation for identifying trends and anomalies in the data.
